# Git Demonstration
Here are some useful commands for Git:
- `git init`: initialises a directory as a Git repo
- `git status`: checks the status of a Git repo
- `git add some_file_name`: adds `some_file_name` to staging
- `git commit -m "some message"`: creates a Git commit with "some message" as the commit message 

Some more commands:
* `git log --graph`: displays a graph of the commits in your repo
* `git branch`: lists the current branches in your repo
* `git branch some_branch_name`: creates a new branch called "some_branch_name"
* `git checkout some_branch_name`: moves the HEAD to the most recent commit on the branch called "some_branch_name"
